# Hands-on with CAP CDS

A hands-on introduction to the key features of the Conceptual Definition
Language (CDL) used in CAP CDS modelling.

## Introduction

The content in this repo is designed for a hands-on workshop that introduces
the key features of CDS modelling, focusing on the Conceptual Definition
Language ([CDL](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl)), the predominantly
declarative domain-specific language (DSL) [in the CDS
family](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/).

The workshop abstract reads: "_Become acquainted with CAP's CDS, the common
language that binds domain experts, with their key business & process
knowledge, to developers. A hands-on-optional session where we'll explore the
language & concepts together and get comfortable with it. (More info is
available on the session detail page)_". For more information about the
workshop, see [Hands-on domain modelling with CAP's CDS at UKISUG

## Prerequisites

In order to work through the exercises, you'll need a development environment for CAP Node.js. See the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) page for details and options.
