# Prerequisites

In order to work through the exercises you'll need a development environment for CAP Node.js, with the latest versions of CDS and the CDS Development Kit ([9.4](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/releases/sep25) at the time of writing).

You have various options - the most straightforward if you're not used to or are unable to set up a development environment on your laptop is to use a dev space in the SAP Business Application Studio. Alternatively you can follow the [Getting Started](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/) guide in Capire (CAP's official documentation).

The SAP Business Application Studio is an online interactive development environment (IDE) that is available on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) and with a BTP trial account access is free.

To get a trial account, follow the tutorial [Get an Account on SAP BTP Trial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html).

Then, to get access to BAS, follow the tutorial [Set Up SAP Business Application Studio for Development](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding.html).

Once you have BAS access, create a dev space in the Dev Space Manager, choosing "Full Stack Cloud Application" in the creation process. This will ensure you have the right set of tools for what we need in this workshop, including the CAP Development Kit.
